# Iot-HomeSensor

An IoT home monitoring system using an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to collect temperature, humidity, and light data. Data is sent via MQTT to a backend server running in Docker, with Node for processing, InfluxDB for storage, and Grafana for real-time visualization. Efficient, scalable, and easy to deploy.
